# 2. Running code

In this project root folder run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependency.

- Run `python main.py` to estimate the 360° optical flow with demo data.

- Run `test_replica360.py` to estimate the 360° optical flow on the whole Replica 360° dataset and quantitative evaluate the result.

# 3. Datasets

- Replica 360°

Please download the Replica 360° optical flow data from [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14O9jP5dknguXMhAsSD5yq1_4tv3pJvm5/view?usp=sharing).

The mask file `xxxx_mask_pano.png` indicate the unavailable pixels.
The value 0 pixel's RGB, depth and optical flow are unavailable, the value 1 pixels are available.

- OmniPhotos

Please download the 360° OmniPhotos dataset from [OmniPhotos webpage](https://richardt.name/publications/omniphotos/).
